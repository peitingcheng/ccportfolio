                    <h2>Reflection</h2><br>
                    <p>After working on this project, I think I’m still afraid of coding… (But I think I'm getting better and better!)
                        <br><br>
                        At first, I started with the idea of making a Ditto from Pokémon. However, I was completely defeated by the Bézier curves. I also tried using Illustrator to draw the shape I wanted and then used the anchor point coordinates from Illustrator to figure out how to draw the curve in p5, but unfortunately, that method didn’t work.
                        <br><br>
                        So, I then thought about how to scale the face from small to large. This made me think that maybe I could use Mondrian as an inspiration, utilizing what we learned with mouseX and mouseY to create changes in the grid on the canvas and adding different faces in each cell.
                        <br><br>
                        There are still some issues, like the faces falling out of the cells when the cursor gets too close to the edge, but that's where I am so far!</p>
