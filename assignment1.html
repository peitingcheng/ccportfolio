                    <h2>Lost and Found</h2>
                    <p>This project is a collaboration with HE, representing his lost memories of his cute bunny.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>She’s a little cute bunny (Holland Lop).<br>She had a black body, white markings on her face, a white belly, and blue eyes.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>This is my first time writing code, and the experience of drawing with code is so different from creating with visual logic in Adobe software. While working on the Lost and Found project, I often thought, “If I were using Illustrator, I’d be done in no time!” But with code, it takes so much longer, and there are more limitations when it comes to drawing. However, after encountering more of p5.js, I realized that it’s not just about drawing—it opens up a lot of possibilities for user interaction, which is something I’m really excited to dive deeper into.
                    <br><br>
                    For this Lost and Found project, I only used very basic code, and I kind of piled a bunch of code together in a messy way to create the shapes I imagined. While coding, I often think, “There must be a smarter way to do this.” I feel like this is a common feeling when we’re experiencing technology. As I continue exploring p5.js, I hope I can keep leveling up, like a wizard in an adventure story, learning to cast more advanced spells!</p>
