                    <h2>Reflection</h2>
                    <p>In this Data Portrait project, I attempted to visualize my daily walking steps between 10 AM and 10 PM.
                        <br><br>
                        Since I moved to New York, I often walk through the streets of the city to save on subway fares. I thought it might be interesting to visualize my daily steps by converting them into the heights of skyscrapers in New York City. Continuing from my previous assignment’s 3D experiment, I used the same 3D setup along with for loops and array functions to construct a walking city map of my weekly steps.
                        <br><br>
                        What I find interesting about the data visualization is that you can see how my daily step count changes based on my class schedule. For example, my step count decreases starting at 12 PM each day, but increases again during the free time after 3 PM. From this visualized data, I can better analyze my daily patterns.</p>
