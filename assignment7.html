                    <h2>Reflection</h2><br>
                    <p>When thinking about my p5 mini-game, l was inspired by two games I really enjoy: Monument Valley and Bart Bonte's Color series. Both of these are primarily puzzle games, with distinctive features like minimalistic art styles and geometric shapes. They incorporate concepts of geometric illusions, providing players with unexpected surprises throughout gameplay.<br><br>
                    For this mini-game, I continued my recent experiments with 3D by creating a small 3D space game in p5. The goal is for players to rotate the game scene to discover hidden objects within each level, ultimately helping the main character find their way home.<br><br>
                    I feel like although it's not a perfect game, it's a good start for me to learn more about p5.js and 3D. And I'll definitely keep working on it to make it better!
