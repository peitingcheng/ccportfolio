                    <p style="color: white;">At the beginning of this experimental clock project, I thought about when I recently felt strongly about the concept of "time." I realized that I am currently in the most active and rapidly changing phase of my life, whereas my mother's time is gradually slowing down. I wanted to express the age difference between me and my mother.
                        <br><br>
                        Initially, I hoped to use two spirals unfolding from the center of the screen, one representing my time and the other representing my mother's time. However, I found that the structure of the spirals required a lot of mathematical calculations, and I had to abandon the idea halfway through my attempts. I then shifted the plan to only represent my own lifespan, thinking it might be simpler. So, I used the map() function to divide the lifespan into two segments. The first segment moves increasingly faster, mirroring my current state of life, while the second segment slows down, representing the gradual aging process. I struggled for a long time trying to create the gradient effect, but later found Kazuki Umeda's tutorial on YouTube, which helped me achieve the desired gradient.
                        <br><br>
                        I found this clock project very challenging, especially in the parts that required a lot of mathematical calculations. I also realized that extracting concepts from other people's code and integrating them into my own is quite a difficult task. However, I learned a lot from this project, and I hope I can gradually improve with each assignment.</p>
